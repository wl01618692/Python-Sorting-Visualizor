# Sorting Visualizer
This is a simple python project to visualize several famous sorting algorithms and generate the animations via Matplotlib.

A simple demo can be found here: https://wl01618692.github.io/Python-Sorting-Visualizor/index.html

The format of command line arguments
python output.py arg1 arg2

    * `play` : Play an animation of a specific sorting algorithm or all algorithms in a new window, as a "figure" to Matplotlib.
    * `save-html` : Save the animation as a HTML page with a sequence of images.
* There are nine posible options as "*arg2*":
    * `all` *(default)* : Show the visualization of all sorting algorithms in the animation.
